# Understanding Our Generalization Bound

This Jupyter notebook serves as a **validation tool** for the theoretical generalization bounds derived in our paper. It numerically evaluates and visualizes the behaviour of the derived bounds under different conditions, allowing for a better understanding of their dependencies and scaling properties.

## 📘 Purpose

- Verify the correctness and sharpness of our theoretical generalization bounds.
- Empirically inspect how the bound behaves with respect to key parameters such as sample size, noise level, network width/depth, or graph properties (depending on context).
- Generate plots and tables that may support or visualize theoretical claims made in the main text.

## 📁 File Contents

- `Understanding_our_Generalization_Bound.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all computations, visualizations, and explanations.

## 🔧 Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
